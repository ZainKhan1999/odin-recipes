    <ul>
      <li>10 ounces spaghetti</li>  
      <li> 4 tablespoons olive oil </li>  
      <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced   </li>  
      <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved  </li>  
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. </li>  
        <li> Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook garlic until translucent and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes. Increase heat, cook, and stir until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. </li>  
        <li> Remove skillet from heat and mix in arugula. Mix in cooked spaghetti and drizzle with olive oil. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese. </li>
